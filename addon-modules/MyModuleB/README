OpenSimTide

This is a ISharedRegion module that controls the tide on your region. It
also reports the current tide level to the region on two channels so that
scripts can use it, for example to make items appear to float.

It is controlled by a [Tide] section in OpenSim.ini, an example is given
below:

[Tide]
    ;# {enabled} {} {Enable the tide to come in and out?} {true false} false
    ;; Tides currently only work on single (non megaregions) regions
    ;# surrounded completely by water
    ;; Anything else will produce wierd results where you may see a big
    ;; vertical 'step' in the ocean
    enabled = true

    ;; update the tide every x simulator frames
    tide_update_rate = 50

    ;; low and high water marks in metres
    tide_low_water = 17
    tide_high_water = 20

    ;; how long in seconds for a complete cycle time low->high->low etc
    tide_cycle_time = 900

    ;; provide tide information on the console?
    tide_info_debug = false

    ;; chat tide info to the whole region?
    tide_info_broadcast = true

    ;; which channel to region chat on for the full tide info
    tide_info_channel = 5555

    ;; which channel to region chat on for just the tide level in metres
    tide_level_channel = 5556


To add this module to your OpenSim, change into your ~/opensim/addon-modules
directory and type:
